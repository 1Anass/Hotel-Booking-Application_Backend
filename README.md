# Hotel-Booking-Application_Backend

This is a hotel booking application backend developed using Spring Boot, Hibernate, and Spring Data. I made use of the several libraries and modules that Spring offers to implement ORM, security configuration, and JWT tokens generation and verification to ensure authentication.
